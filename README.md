Option A: Penguins https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv

## Reflections
• The hardest part was definitely trying to get get the virtual environment going, primarily due to DLSU's internet connection being so difficult to work with that it prevented us from accessing GitHub or even installing libraries into our virtual environment

• Git add, push, and commits make group code repositories fully non-contact and instant--no need for passing code through text in instant messaging apps or through a flash drive. It's also a useful feature in determining whose contribution a particular thing was from, I imagine it's important for documentation, crediting work, and accountability altogether.
