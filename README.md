# README BABY ONE MORE TIME

## Chosen Dataset
Option A: Penguins https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv

## How to Run
`python analyze.py`

## What it does
Running the code will display the dimensions of the dataset (or the number of rows/columns), the column names, the first five rows of the dataset, and the average bill length in mm of each species (Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adelie), the last of which would be plotted on a bar plot as a visualization.

## Reflections
- The hardest part was definitely trying to get the virtual environment going, primarily due to DLSU's internet connection being so difficult to work with that it prevented us from accessing GitHub or even installing libraries into our virtual environment

- Git add, push, and commits make group code repositories fully non-contact and instant--no need for passing code through text in instant messaging apps or through a flash drive. It's also a useful feature in determining whose contribution a particular thing was from, I imagine it's important for documentation, crediting work, and accountability altogether.
